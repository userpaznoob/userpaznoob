- 👋 Hello anyone who read this, I’m @userpaznoob
- 👀 I’m interested in learning C# for future developing, as one of my friends told me that it is more used than C or C++ nowadays
- 🌱 And unfortunately, I’m having to learn C to get long-lasting basic stuff before advancing
- 💞️ For now, I’m not looking to collaborate on someone yet
- 📫 And for now, idk what to say, but thanks for reading this anyway
